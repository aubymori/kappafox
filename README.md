# Nara

An experimental Mozilla-based web browser. Stay tuned!

## Contributing

Because Nara is forked from Firefox, its documentation mostly applies for us as well. Since we are restoring old technologies, there is
some more archaic knowledge that Mozilla removed from their upstream documentation.

Please read https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/directory_structure.html to understand the Mozilla directory structure.

Here are some useful sources for Mozilla documentation (in order):

1. [Mozilla Wiki (Gecko:Overview)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:Overview) - by far the most useful source to understanding the Mozilla framework architecture.
2. [Firefox Source Docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/) - pertains more to modern Firefox specifically.
3. [UDN Web Docs](https://udn.realityripple.com/) - a mirror of old Mozilla Developer Network content (i.e. XPCOM stuff) which has since been removed.
4. [Isabella's Documentation](https://kawapure.github.io/mozilla_simple_docs/) - written by a Nara developer and aims to provide a good introduction to the Mozilla framework.
